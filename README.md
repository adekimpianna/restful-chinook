## Introduction
In this project the user targeted is company's employees, let's say some people from Sales or Accounting.

Here we want a user to be able to find and see records about customers and their invoices by providing an input or a word that needs to be searched. Any data that contains this key-search will be appear on the table. The user will not be able to modify the content of the data at this moment as it is provided beforehand. 

This project can be still developed into something better in the future. This project is an open-ended project where we are free to create anything we want, at this moment we are thinking in as simple way.
